    "As it was stated in the lecture, depending on the number of bins we get the more accurate shape of a histogram. We should be careful while choosing the number of bins as we might loose information and end up with incorrect distribution if we choose too small or too large number of bins. If we have big number of bins the histogram has many peaks(or if there are fewer samples than bins, we have gaps) and with small number, there are fewer peaks and it is hard to determine which distribution we are dealing with. Sometimes it is better to combine some cells in order to end up with smoother histograms. As a rule of thumb in the lecture it was presented that we should take square root of the number of samples."
